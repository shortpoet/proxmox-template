# packer-proxmox-template

Packer configuration for creating Debian 10 virtual machine templates for Proxmox VE.

## Requirements

- [Packer](https://www.packer.io/downloads) 1.6.6+
- [Proxmox VE](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve) 6.2+

## Minimum background information

Launching a virtual machine requires an operating system to be installed. VM installation is usually done using an ISO image file and depending on the OS, this can be a time consuming task one might want to avoid. Luckily, this can be automated using a process known as _preseeding_.

> Preseeding provides a way to answer questions asked during the installation process, without having to manually enter the answers while the installation is running. You can check out the configuration for a standard Debian 10 installation in [preseed.cfg](preseed.cfg) and read more about this method in the [preseed documentation](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Preseed).

Proxmox Templates provide an easy way to deploy many VMs of the same type, but naturally we don't want them to be _completely_ identical. They may need a different hostname, an IP address, etc. This is what _cloud-init_ takes care of.

> Cloud-init is used for initial machine configuration like creating users or preseeding `authorized_keys` file for SSH authentication. You can check out the configuration in [cloud.cfg](cloud.cfg) and read more about this in [cloud-init documentation](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Creating a new VM Template

Templates are created by converting an existing VM to a template. As soon as the VM is converted, it cannot be started anymore. If you want to modify an existing template, you need to create a new template.

Here's how to do all that in one step:

```sh
$ packer build debian-10-buster.json
proxmox: output will be in this color.

==> proxmox: Creating VM
==> proxmox: No VM ID given, getting next free from Proxmox
==> proxmox: Starting VM

...

==> proxmox: Stopping VM
==> proxmox: Converting VM to template
Build 'proxmox' finished.

==> Builds finished. The artifacts of successful builds are:
--> proxmox: A template was created: 102
```

Values from the `variables` section in `debian-10-buster.json` can be overidden like so:

```
$ packer build -var "proxmox_host=10.10.0.10:8006" debian-10-buster.json
```

or you can just as easily specify a file that contains the variables:

```sh
$ packer build -var-file example-variables.json debian-10-buster.json
```

## Deploy a VM from a Template

Right-click the template in Proxmox VE, and select "Clone".

- **full clone** is a complete copy and is fully independent from the original VM or VM Template, but it requires the same disk space as the original
- **linked clone** requires less disk space but cannot run without access to the base VM Template. Not supported with LVM & ISCSI storage types
